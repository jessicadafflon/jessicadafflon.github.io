However, from the vast extent of possible ML algorithms, which one is the optimal model to predict the target variable? What are the hyperparameters for such a model? Given the plethora of possible answers to these questions, in the last years, automated ML (autoML) has been gaining attention. Here, we apply an autoML library called Tree‚Äêbased Pipeline Optimisation Tool (TPOT) which uses a tree‚Äêbased representation of ML pipelines and conducts a genetic programming‚Äêbased approach to find the model and its hyperparameters that more closely predicts the subject‚Äôs true age. To explore autoML and evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging data sets, we chose a problem that has been the focus of previous extensive study: brain age prediction. Without any prior knowledge, TPOT was able to scan through the model space and create pipelines that outperformed the state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart accuracy for Freesurfer‚Äêbased models using only thickness and volume information for anatomical structure. In particular, we compared the performance of TPOT (mean absolute error [MAE]: 4.612‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ.124‚Äâyears) and a relevance vector regression (MAE 5.474‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ.140‚Äâyears). TPOT also suggested interesting combinations of models that do not match the current most used models for brain prediction but generalise well to unseen data. AutoML showed promising results as a data‚Äêdriven approach to find optimal models for neuroimaging applications.\n","date":1595462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595462400,"objectID":"8f6a6381998a3338962920a3e9971629","permalink":"https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/tpot-age/","publishdate":"2020-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tpot-age/","section":"project","summary":"In neuroscience, the choice of the machine learning algorithm and its hyperparameters, are often arbitrary and frequently do not correspond to the statistical properties of the data being analysed.

A bewildering array of adaptive and sophisticated behaviours can be observed from large ensembles of elementary agents such as ant colonies, bird flocks or by the interactions of elementary material units such as molecules or weather elements. Ultimately, emergence has been adopted as the ontological support of a number of attempts to model brain function. This manuscript aims to clarify the ontology of emergence and delve into its many facets, particularly into its \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\" versions that underpin two different approaches to the modelling of behaviour. The first group of models is here represented by the \\\"free energy\\\" principle of brain function and the \\\"integrated information theory\\\" of consciousness. The second group is instead represented by computational models such as oscillatory networks that use mathematical scalable representations to generate emergent behaviours and are then able to bridge neurobiology with higher mental functions. Drawing on the epistemological literature, we observe that due to their loose mechanistic links with the underlying biology, models based on strong forms of emergence are at risk of metaphysical implausibility. This, in practical terms, translates into the over determination that occurs when the proposed model becomes only one of a large set of possible explanations for the observable phenomena. On the other hand, computational models that start from biologically plausible elementary units, hence are weakly emergent, are not limited by ontological faults and, if scalable and able to realistically simulate the hierarchies of brain output, represent a powerful vehicle for future neuroscientific research programmes.","tags":["Bayesian inference; Brain; Computational models; Emergence; Free energy principle; Integrated information theory; Multi-scale; Oscillators; Strong emergence; Weak emergence"],"title":"Conflicting emergences.
