Inhalation of air enriched with carbon dioxide (CO2) in healthy humans provides a novel experimental model of generalised anxiety, but has not previously been used to assess cognition. We used inhalation of 7.5% CO2 to induce acute anxiety and autonomic arousal in healthy volunteers during neuropsychological tasks of cognitive flexibility, emotional processing and spatial working memory in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, within-subjects study. In Experiment 1 (n = 44), participants made significantly more extra-dimensional shift errors on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift task under CO2 inhalation compared with 'normal' air. Participants also had slower latencies when responding to positive words and made significantly more omission errors for negative words on the CANTAB Affective Go/No-go task. In Experiment 2 (n = 28), participants made significantly more total errors and had poorer heuristic search strategy on the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task. In both experiments, CO2 inhalation significantly increased negative affect; state anxiety and fear; symptoms of panic; and systolic blood pressure/heart rate. Overall, CO2 inhalation produced robust anxiogenic effects and impaired fronto-executive functions of cognitive flexibility and working memory. Effects on emotional processing suggested a mood-congruent slowing in processing speed in the absence of a negative attentional bias. State-dependent effects of anxiety on cognitive-emotional interactions in the prefrontal cortex warrant further investigation.","tags":null,"title":"Acute anxiety and autonomic arousal induced by CO2 inhalation impairs prefrontal executive functions in healthy humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico E Turkheimer","Peter Hellyer","Angie A Kehagia","Paul Expert","Louis-David Lord","Jakub Vohryzek","Jessica De Faria Dafflon","Mick Brammer","Robert Leech"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"5e570de576a95f9a8d275921bf786e0a","permalink":"https://jessicadafflon.github.io/publication/turkheimer-2019-conflicting/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T20:49:06.542584Z","relpermalink":"/publication/turkheimer-2019-conflicting/","section":"publication","summary":"The concept of \"emergence\" has become commonplace in the modelling of complex systems, both natural and man-made; a functional property\" emerges\" from a system when it cannot be readily explained by the properties of the system's sub-units. A bewildering array of adaptive and sophisticated behaviours can be observed from large ensembles of elementary agents such as ant colonies, bird flocks or by the interactions of elementary material units such as molecules or weather elements. Ultimately, emergence has been adopted as the ontological support of a number of attempts to model brain function. This manuscript aims to clarify the ontology of emergence and delve into its many facets, particularly into its \"strong\" and \"weak\" versions that underpin two different approaches to the modelling of behaviour. The first group of models is here represented by the \"free energy\" principle of brain function and the \"integrated information theory\" of consciousness. The second group is instead represented by computational models such as oscillatory networks that use mathematical scalable representations to generate emergent behaviours and are then able to bridge neurobiology with higher mental functions. Drawing on the epistemological literature, we observe that due to their loose mechanistic links with the underlying biology, models based on strong forms of emergence are at risk of metaphysical implausibility. This, in practical terms, translates into the over determination that occurs when the proposed model becomes only one of a large set of possible explanations for the observable phenomena. On the other hand, computational models that start from biologically plausible elementary units, hence are weakly emergent, are not limited by ontological faults and, if scalable and able to realistically simulate the hierarchies of brain output, represent a powerful vehicle for future neuroscientific research programmes.","tags":["Bayesian inference; Brain; Computational models; Emergence; Free energy principle; Integrated information theory; Multi-scale; Oscillators; Strong emergence; Weak emergence"],"title":"Conflicting emergences.
