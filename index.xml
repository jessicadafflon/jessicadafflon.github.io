      <title>Predicting Age from Neuroimaging using an Automated Machine Learning approach (autoML)</title>
      <link>https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/tpot-age/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has significantly increased in neuroscience. However, from the vast extent of possible ML algorithms, which one is the optimal model to predict the target variable? What are the hyperparameters for such a model? Given the plethora of possible answers to these questions, in the last years, automated ML (autoML) has been gaining attention. Here, we apply an autoML library called Tree‐based Pipeline Optimisation Tool (TPOT) which uses a tree‐based representation of ML pipelines and conducts a genetic programming‐based approach to find the model and its hyperparameters that more closely predicts the subject&amp;rsquo;s true age. To explore autoML and evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging data sets, we chose a problem that has been the focus of previous extensive study: brain age prediction. Without any prior knowledge, TPOT was able to scan through the model space and create pipelines that outperformed the state‐of‐the‐art accuracy for Freesurfer‐based models using only thickness and volume information for anatomical structure. In particular, we compared the performance of TPOT (mean absolute error [MAE]: 4.612 ± .124 years) and a relevance vector regression (MAE 5.474 ± .140 years). TPOT also suggested interesting combinations of models that do not match the current most used models for brain prediction but generalise well to unseen data. AutoML showed promising results as a data‐driven approach to find optimal models for neuroimaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A comparison between machine learning to predict brain age</title>
      <link>https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/age-comparison/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Different algorithms have been used to predict brain age from structural images.
However, every study uses different algorithms on different datasets, making it
difficult to compare the results among each other. This project aimed to bridge
this gap and rigorously compare the most commonly used algorithms to predict
brain age and to compare the impact of using different inputs on the precision
of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Embodied Simulation of the Human Brain</title>

      <description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Although different computational models have been developed to investigate
the neural dynamics of the brain, less is known about the brain-environment
interaction and how the latter influence brain dynamics. Therefore,
we developed a virtual agent, whose activity is driven by a computational
model, and analysed how the environment
influenced its neural dynamics. The interaction of all these elements is illustrated in the video found on the top of this page
 My role in this project was to port the
model from C# into Python, develop methods to analyse the virtual agent&#39;s
behaviour, and study its neural dynamics using graph
theory measures. The linked poster also provide a detailed description of the
project.

      <title>Computational Models of Social Learning and Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/social-dcm/</link>

      <guid>https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/social-dcm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aimed to develop and test computational models
of learning that quantify how people learn under social uncertainty .We
used a combination of methods, which included: hierarchical Bayesian
model of learning, model-based fMRI and DCMs.
The poster on this project description summaries the main results of this
project. Our
results showed the importance of the neurotransmitter dopamine in updating prediction errors
in the social context.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementation of Large-scale Brain Simulations on NeuroML</title>
      <link>https://jessicadafflon.github.io/project/neuroml/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aimed to implement Large-scale Brain Simulations,
which are models that simulate the interaction between different
brain areas, in NeuroML.
NeuroML is a tool that standardises commonly used parameters to describe
neuroscience models. This standardisation is essential for making
computational models used in neuroscience easily shareable and
reproducible. I have implemented and open-sourced three different
models: 1) Wilson and Cowan, 2) delMolino, and 2) MejiasEtAl2016.
A detailed description of the analysis can be found on the pdf linked to this
page, which was presented at the CNS 2019 in Barcelona. With this project, I
learned how to use numba, intensively used git and learned how to
collaborate on an open science project.&lt;/p&gt;
